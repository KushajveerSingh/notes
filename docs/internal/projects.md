## Better Tech Name

-   Come up with alternative names for GPUs/CPUs/RAM/Monitors (desktop, enterprise, mobile).
-   General strategy, bigger the number better the product. Make the final name with the mindset the meaning of the numbers is irrelevant.
-   Consult research papers to understand the architecture of each product.
-   Have a section for each product to explain the rationale behind the name.

## Internet v2

No HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Use Rust for everything, and create a browser in Rust.

-   Reinvent internet.
-   Identify all the web standards, and make your own version of the standards.
-   Start by modifying the HTML parser in Chromium with one in Rust, move to CSS, JS, and keep adding standards. Over time replace Chromium with a version of Rust.
    -   For the name of the browser, look up ancient words that mean starting over.
-   Add parsers/viewers/formatters for all file types, like images, audio, video, pdf, json, programming languages.
-   After a working browser has been created. Create a clone of all the popular apps, if multiple can be consolidated into one do that. And make these part of the browser.
    -   If a backend server is needed, divide the expenses among all the people signed up for the service. Add a small fee for personal fund, reinvesting into the product/new products.
