## Product design

We help companies design better products and ultimately better product experiences. This includes creating new product categories, full product prototyping and redesign and visual/aesthetic improvement of existing products.

We created a modular office furniture system for the customer service centers of a large corporation and we are helping a Kuwait-based catering business design innovative food service vessels and cutlery.

## Service design

‍Our understanding of complex business processes, business technology systems as well as our ability to design and deliver user interfaces/user experiences that cover physical outlets, web/mobile platforms and paper-based communication enables us to partner with organization to design services that add value through faster transaction times, smoother interactions and a reduction in complaints and errors.
‍
We have worked with a Gulf-based road and transport authority to redesign dozens of their e-services, and we have delivered service interfaces in the fields of banking, telecom and e-government.
