## Innovation & creative strategies

We work with companies and organizations to imagine and identify new innovative avenues of growth, improve products and services and launch ground breaking new ventures and startups.
‍
We have helped a major investment company launch a new facet of its organization to reaching the emerging audience of entrepreneurs in the Arab region, and we have helped a startup team develop an innovative approach to building a job search site around the needs of job seekers and HR professionals.

## Touchpoint integration

We bring a customer and human centric approach to audit, assess, re-imagine and design an organizations touch points and interfaces. We observe and analyze customer/audience behavior and journeys, covering both physical and digital channels and design improved experiences that address customer needs, overcome difficulties and disconnects and that present a coherent brand language and service logic across different platforms.
‍
We have helped a major bank redesign its branch experience in the context of a total rebranding project and we are helping an emerging global transport and logistics company create a unified approach to designing its retail outlets.
