## Corporate Branding

We help organizations large and small discover and articulate the soul and essence of their organizations, in a way that makes their uniqueness visible and tangible to customers, workers and the community. We design and deliver the conceptual, visual and verbal assets that are needed to create clear and consistent brand communication across channels.

We have recently helped a regional loyalty card program company re-articulate their brand promise and create a fresh new visual identity for all their touch points, re-branded a major financial institution, repositioned and redesigned a home appliance brand and created brands for numerous startups in the consumer and business-to-business sectors.

## Product Branding

We create product branding solutions that encompass packaging design, retail displays, product informational material as well as creating product family naming systems. Our approach emphasizes the reduction of visual clutter, clarity of communication and a striking, differentiated shelf presence.

We have designed groundbreaking branding and packaging design for a regional beverage company helping them take market leadership in the first year of their operation, and we worked with a Jordanian agricultural company to design a packaging system for the export of their produce to European markets.

## City/Country Branding

Bringing together our cultural curiosity, understanding of urbanism and regional tourism with our branding, design and communication capabilities, we have created a solid practice in the field of city, tourism and regional branding.
‍
We have created the first citizen-centric comprehensive branding initiative for Jordan’s capital, Amman, and we have worked with national and local tourism authorities to create tourism destination brands for regional and international audience
